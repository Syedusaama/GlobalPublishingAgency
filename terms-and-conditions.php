            “Customer,” “You,” or “Yours” refers to you and/or any other person submitting an order to the Global Publishing Center on your behalf.

            <h5>OUR SERVICES</h5>
            By submitting the order and/or payment, you are purchasing the product for your use only. All products are drafted by freelance writers who have transferred all rights and ownership regarding the products to the company. All products are non-refundable and come with no warranties, expressed or implied. It is your obligation to read these terms and conditions before submitting any order and/or payment to this Website.

            <h5>REFUND POLICY</h5>
            It is important that you read and fully understand the refund policy to have full knowledge of the privileges and limitations governed by the Global Publishing Center policy.

            We offer refunds only in special cases and under specified conditions, detailed as follows:

            <h5>CHANGE OF MIND:</h5>
            The customer is entitled to a 100% refund before our writers/editors start working on the project.

            If, for any reason, you change your mind and decide against continuing your project with us after placing your order, you can request a refund within the first hour of placing your order. A 15% processing fee will be charged in other cases.

            <h5>INCOMPETENT DELIVERY:</h5>
            Once the work is delivered, customers are only entitled to claim a refund once they have exhausted all the options detailed below;

            If the work does not comply with project requirements (as requested/documented by the customer). We are committed to providing our customers with 100% satisfaction and offer unlimited revisions to ensure that the delivery is up to the mark. We assign, re-assign, and re-write your work to ensure complete satisfaction.

            Reserve FREE pages for the future, but of the same value, and you can avail of them at any time.

            If we are still unable to deliver what you asked for, a refund will be processed with a mutual agreement on a set percentage (but only in cases where the delivery is completely off the mark).

            <h5>LATE DELIVERY:</h5>
            We believe in “On Time Delivery” but if, for any reason, we fail to deliver the requested service on time, after at least three attempts to contact us, your refund will be processed once it is established through documentary evidence that the late delivery was the company’s fault.

            <h5>REFUND TIME FRAME:</h5>
            Refunds must be claimed within 120 days of delivery. Refunds claimed after the set time frame will not be entertained.

            All customers must note the deadline for claiming a refund at the time of placing the order.

            <h5>REFUNDS WILL NOT BE GIVEN IN FOLLOWING SITUATIONS</h5>

            If there is a delay in delivery due to minor technical issues like grammatical errors, typing errors, word count, or missing references, refunds will be given only with mutual agreement, and the company will provide only partial refunds or discounts for future purchases.
            The Global Publishing Center will not be held responsible for any delay caused by the client.
            Refunds will not be provided based on low-quality writing.
